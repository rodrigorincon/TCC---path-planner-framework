 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   The mobile robotics is concerned to bring machines to move themselves autonomously. For achieve this goal it was divided into smaller challenges that needed to be treated. One and addressed in this paper is the path planning to be taken. Whereas the environment around is already known, the robot needs to define a secure way to get where it wants without colliding with obstacles. Several algorithms for this were developed, and this paper aims to provide a framework that provides such ready-made solutions to the programmer. Through design patterns the framework is designed for easy switching between algorithms without affecting the rest of the code. Apart from the implementation of these algorithms is designed an architecture that allows portability to as many different platforms, worrying about reuse and code readability. The framework communicates with the other modules of robot moving by a simple and common interface to all algorithms. Importantly, the control module of the hardware and move it in fact is not part of the scope of this paper, but chat with them and gives you a series of coordinates for where it should go. This work will be open-source, developed in Java and tested on differential steering robots of the educational LEGO Mindstorm NXT kit.
